                <p>This is an Application made using Java Swings. Java Swing is a part of Java Foundation Classes (JFC)
                    that is used to create window-based applications. It is built on the top of AWT (Abstract Windowing
                    Toolkit) API and entirely written in java.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Unlike AWT, Java Swing provides platform-independent and lightweight components.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The javax.swing package provides classes for java swing API such as JButton, JTextField, JTextArea,
                    JRadioButton, JCheckbox, JMenu, JColorChooser etc.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This is a Tic-Tac-Toe game application in which two players can play the game comfortably. The game
                    is made using different color indications and also with the instruction panel which states whose
                    turn is this or right now. If any one of the player wins the game then the row or column or diagonal color
                    is turned green and game stops. "X" and "O" are not fixed each time you play the game, this program
                    takes help of random function of Random class of java to generate two values based on which the first turn i.e,
                    "X" or "O" is decided.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Players can see the instruction panel which shows whose turn is this i.e, "X Turn" or "O
                    Turn" based on which players can decide their turns and play the game. It also has a feature of New
                    Game Button on clicking which a new game is started. If both "X" and "O" doesn't win the game then
                    on clicking new button game will start again and players can play the game continuously with out
                    closing and running the application again and again.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It is a very light weight application made using only single frame, it doesnot create new frame each
                    time we click on New Game button. It runs on single frame from the time we run it to the time we
                    close it. You can also resume palying the game if any one of the player wins. On winning the game is
                    stopped and the winner name is dispalyed on instruction panel and if the players want to continue
                    playing the game then they can make use of New Game button
